# contextcounter

Count the number of opportunities a particular genome/exome/panel offers for mutations in each sequence context evaluated in mutational signature analysis.

These counts are used to optimise whole-genome derived mutational signature analysis tools like the sigstats R package.


## Installation

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/CCICB/contextcounter
